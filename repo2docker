Please type in the following command to create the jupyter notebook of all the codes in our github repository:

Part1: jupyter-repo2docker https://github.com/MarcusNEU/INFO7390_A3_P1

Part2: jupyter-repo2docker https://github.com/MarcusNEU/INFO7390_A3_P2

notice that:jupyter-repo2docker can only be used in python3+ environment.
For part2, since all the codes all python scripts but not jupyter notebook, you need to create a cell and simply run this line "%run prediction_application.py" to run the application.
